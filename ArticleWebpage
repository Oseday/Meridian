									<h1>MERIDIAN WEBSITE<br />
									GOES LIVE</h1>
									<p>Through blood, sweat, tears, and a lot of SSHTP errors,<br />
									the Meridian website has gone live. Now we just need to prod Kiyo<br />
									until we have some content.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ambientBackground1.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Through sickness, and through health, the Meridian Team has persevered through time and trials to the point in which we have 
								reached now. We've created a massive new piece of gameplay onto the Roblox platform, Expanse; Skirmisher, or as we call it, 
								Skirmisher. Skirmisher is a MOBA, of sorts, which uses the combat mechanics of Expanse, along with it's ships. 
								Skirmisher is our avenue to creating the best possible space sim combat, similar to that of Star Citizens "Arena Commander." We
								use a physics based flight system, high detail ships, multi-crewed vessels so you can team up with your friends in a single ship,
								and UI based weaponry. All of which is much more than most have accomplished. However, with all this work and effort, it took us
								nearly 3 years to develop fully. </p>

								<p>One of the major aspects of Skirmisher is of course what you see, and what you see 100% of the time is the UI and HUD. The UI is what you see for ship selection, the menus, and all the little buttons that go with it, while the HUD, or Heads Up Display, is your shield and hull stats, the notification menu on the right, and the crew member specific mechanics, like the Engineer's stat wheel. The team behind this work is the Art Department, led by the one and only, DoubleDog_DareMe. DoubleDog is a man of many skills. He creates most of the skins we have available for the ships, he's made the majority of the UI/HUD in Skirmisher, and all of the concepts work on Expanse's UI. However, he does not work alone; he has a friend come along with him to create the small, yet important details and that is ZiggiousZaggious. Ziggious has been with us for quite some time and works on the icons for ships, weaponry, and more. He's a big factor in what we can accomplish because of his style and work ethic.</p>
								<p>Along with UI, another big source of content you see is from the biggest team we have, the Build Department. The Lead of the build team is AlexiRyaov. Alexi has been with the team for quite some time, and is one of the oldest members in Meridian and really shows it. Along with Alexi, he currently has 7 other members on his team. Alexi and his team have been working relentlessly to create all of the ships, the battlezones, the ship interiors, stations, every tiny detail you see in the areas is all their work. Alexi has been with the team for quite some time. However, with the build team, there's also a sub-team. Due to the fact that they go hand-in-hand to make the aesthetic view of the game fit together, we have the effects team. The effects team is composed of the audio engineers, 
 musical masterminds, and the overall Visual Effects that come along with the battlezones, such as the beams or lasers that you see.</p>
								<p> The four smaller teams in the Meridian Studios are all lead by a single member, AlexanderKotevski. Alexander is the big man of the house, the breadwinner, the big guy up high. He leads the Marketing, Writing, Balancing, and Gameplay Directive teams. The marketing team is responsible for getting our name out there, becoming known and to let people know what we're doing. A Public Relations of sorts. Writing is taking care of our lore. The big story behind it all. Every nook cranny and crevice could have a name and story to go with it and it's all up to this team to do it. The Balancing team helps direct ships stats, turret values, and all the things that tie down gameplay and how we think it should be played. And finally, the Gameplay team. Gameplay is basically taking care of the statistics. Looking at what game modes are being played the most, which ship is the favorite, and all of that fun stuff.</p>
								<p>The biggest and most complex team is the Programming team, lead by the Lord himself, Oseday. Oseday has been with the team since the big bang. He's been solely working on Skirmisher for quite some time and only just recently added a new team member, ZacBytes. Oseday has created so many new aspects on Roblox with his physics-based movement, the work behind the UI based weaponry, complex content behind AI crew members, aim assist, manual gunner mechanics, and so much more behind the scenes that we can't wrap our head around.</p>
